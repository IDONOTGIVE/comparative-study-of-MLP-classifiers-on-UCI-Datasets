comparative-study-of-MLP-classifiers-on-UCI-Datasets
====================================================

In this project, there are two parts of work to do. First, comparison of different kinds of BP algorithms, after training and testing, CPU time of running the programs is needed. The other part is to implement Auto encoder classifier and minimum distance classifier, and then compare these two classifiers with KNN and RBF. Also Bagging or boosting classifier ensemble should be implementing and compare with other four classifiers. Through obtained result, Bagging MLP classifier is prove to have Accuracy Rate, however CPU time of Bagging is huge.
